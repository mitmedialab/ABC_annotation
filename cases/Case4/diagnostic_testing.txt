Dr. Martin: A repeat electrocardiogram obtained 4 hours after presentation to the academic health center (Fig. 2B) showed normal sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopic beats. There were persis- tent ST-segment elevations in leads I and aVL, with broad inverted T waves. The QTc interval was 462 msec.
The next day, the test of the nasopharyngeal swab obtained during the patientâ€™s evaluation at the first hospital returned positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. A repeat measurement of the C-reactive protein level was higher than the upper limit detectable by the assay (300 mg per liter). The interleukin-6 level was 412 pg per milliliter (ref- erence range, <5.0). Cardiac MRI was deferred.
